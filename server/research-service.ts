For each research finding:
1. Provide a concise title that summarizes the key finding
2. Write a paragraph (3-5 sentences) that explains the research in accessible language
3. Include a realistic academic source (journal name and year)

Format each item as:
TITLE: [title]
CONTENT: [content paragraph]
SOURCE: [journal name (year)]

Focus on factual, evidence-based information from peer-reviewed sources. Emphasize practical applications that can help individuals in recovery. Include specific statistics and research findings when available.
